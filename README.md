This study is a proof-of-concept of using the machine learning nearest neighbours regressor algorithm for handling those substances' properties tables in an accurate, general, and time-efficient way that can be adapted to work on any other fluid. The study was established on refrigerant R134-a for all of those thermodynamic and thermophysical properties provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
